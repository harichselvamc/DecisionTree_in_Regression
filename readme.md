# Decision Tree Regression for Carseats Dataset
## Overview
This repository contains a Decision Tree Regression implemented in R programming for analyzing the Carseats dataset. The primary objective is to predict sales based on various features present in the dataset

## Dataset

The dataset utilized for this project is the default Carseats dataset provided by R. It encompasses essential information, including features like price, advertising budget, shelving location, and other factors that could impact the sales of car seats.


## Files

- **main.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook contains all the code for data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. It serves as the central hub for understanding the project's workflow.

## Dependencies

Ensure the following R packages are installed:

- `rpart`: For constructing decision trees.
- `MASS`: For datasets and additional functionalities.
- `Metrics`: For model evaluation metrics.
- `tree`: For constructing and visualizing decision trees.


Install these packages using the following commands:

```
install.packages("rpart")
install.packages("caTools")
install.packages("MASS")
install.packages("Metrics")
install.packages("tree")
```


## Usage

1. **Clone the repository to your local machine:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/harichselvamc/DecisionTree_in_Regression.git
    ```

2. **Open and run the `main.ipynb` notebook in your R environment.**
